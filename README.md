# DatabaseFinalProject

# To utilize this book fetch system, users will need a computer that can execute Python files and host a local SQL database. To start the application, first run table_creation.sql followed by data_insertion.sql (run both in an IDE that supports SQL like SQL Workbench). Then, run Main.py in an IDE that can execute Python files, such as Visual Studio Code (the program will not work if you run any of the other Python files first). Ensure the terminal that the Python code is executing on is FULL SCREEN (otherwise printed lists will look wrong)
