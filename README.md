# DatabaseFinalProject

# To utilize this book fetch system, users will need a computer that can execute Python files and host a local SQL database. To start the application, first run table_creation.sql followed by data_insertion.sql (run both in an IDE that supports SQL like SQL Workbench). Then, run Main.py in a program that can execute Python files, such as Visual Studio Code (the program will not work if you run any of the other Python files first).
